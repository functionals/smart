# smart
SMART stands for Systems Management of Alert Responsive Tasks.

This buffer is an updated version of one originally programmed as a requirement for NASA Space Grant Consortium funding.  The initial application was for the management of multi-sensory artificial intellegince designed in 2011.  The model began in a predicate calculus and was proven decidable as a context-free grammar.  The updates of the latest version restrict input and learning algorithms to text and sound, removing attempts at incorporation vision.  The output remains as both text and sound.

First and foremost, SMART is a parser with a skeletal outline of a learning algorithm.
